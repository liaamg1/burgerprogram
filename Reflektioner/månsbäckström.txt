2024-09-20:
Today i have created a simple project
EXECUTED:
•	Python installed
•	Flask installed
•	VS CODE will be my text editor, also used in other courses
•	Tried to enter localhost:5000, with the simple message of: (“<h1>”Hello World</h1>”)
Approximately 3 hours work
Until next time:
Next time I want to enter localhost:5000, I am not sure what the issue is of right now I might try to use another text editor,
