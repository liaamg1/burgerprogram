Introduction:
Teammembers: Ritvars Birovs, Hugo Jismark, Liam Gustafsson, Levin Bandrez, Måns Bäckström

2024-09-20:
Today i have created a simple project
EXECUTED:
•	Python installed
•	Flask installed
•	VS CODE will be my text editor, also used in other courses
•	Tried to enter localhost:5000, with the simple message of: (“<h1>”Hello World</h1>”)
Approximately: 3 hours work
Until next time:
Next time I want to enter localhost:5000, I am not sure what the issue is of right now I might try to use another text editor,
Collaboration:
Our group has had multiple sessions debating on how to get started on the project and what tools to use. Example of these
tools are JavaScript, Node, HTML, and Flask. Flask was our pick when the teacher said we could use it and created a example
using Flask. Our group tried to create seperate branches for Configure management but it didn't work out for us so we decided to 
commit into the main branch when commiting a change.

The problems from last update: 
The problems from last update were easily fixed with:  if __name__ == '__main__':
Since the last update I have gotten an understanding of Docker, html, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, MySQL, API, GUI, DATABAS, GIT and GITHUB.
EXECUTED:
•	Docker installed
•	MySQL installed
•	GIT installed
•	SQLAlchemy installed
•   Jinja2 installed
I have learnt that there are multiple SQL,s you can use and our group has tried MySQL, SQLAlchemy and SQLlite3
Git commands:
Get started with git:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"
git config --global push.default matching
git config --global alias.co checkout
git init
touch .gitignore ( creates a file that ignores unnecessary data when you commit)
Commit with git:
git add . (adds everything from your project in your current file position)
git commit -am ‘comment’
Approximately 16 hours work
Collaboration:
We have decided upon using Flask, Jinja2, HTML 

2024-10-14
Since the last update we have decided that our current solution to writing code was to hard to understand, the problem was that the HTML code
was written with our Python code. To fix this i created a folder called templates and to access this code you just have to
add render_templates in the beginning. This way it was easier for our group to write code. In the folder templates html
files will be kept. 
EXECUTED:
•   added render_templates
•   added folder (templates) 
•   HTML file index was added, INDEX gives a simple Introduction to localhost:5000
Approximately 12 hours work
Until next time:
We are having issues with the SQL, many hours go to watching informational videos that allow us to have a proper 
database. At this moment we use SQLlite3 and we are having issues with it.
