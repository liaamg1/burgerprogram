Configuration Management
Configuration management aims to ensure that software products remain consistent and that changes are handled in a structured manner.
During our project, we used Git to control and organize changes in the code. This allowed us to:
Track Changes
We could easily see what changes were made, by whom, and when.
This was particularly important when we needed to track bugs or revert to previous versions.

Collaborating Effectively
By using branches, we were able to work on different features without disturbing each other’s work. 
This facilitated collaboration within the team and helped us keep the code organized. We communicated continuously throughout the project to better understand what was happening and what had been written.

Reverting to Previous Versions
If we encountered issues with a new feature, we could easily revert to a stable version of the code, saving time and reducing stress during development. 
In the context of the project, we learned the importance of having a clear strategy for configuration management to minimize conflicts and facilitate a smooth development process.

What Went Well?
We effectively used Git to manage our project and track our progress. We could easily collaborate by creating and switching branches. 
By making frequent commits and using clear messages, we kept our code organized.

What Went Less Well?
We faced issues regarding the SQL connection to Docker Compose, and we had a very hard time choosing the database.

How Did We Solve Difficulties?
We improved our communication within the team and began discussing which parts of the code we would work on before starting our changes. This reduced the number of conflicts.

What Did We Not Manage to Solve?
We had various problems with databases that wouldn’t connect or return a value; however, we eventually managed to resolve those issues. 
Additionally, Docker was problematic at times, as we couldn’t start both the kitchen and app simultaneously to test our project. Nevertheless, we managed to fix that in the end.
