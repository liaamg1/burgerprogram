*** Burger Project ***
-----------------------------------------------------------

** Introduction **

This repository contains the work of a student team project developed by:

- Ritvars Birovs
- Hugo Jismark
- Liam Gustafsson
- Levin Bandrez
- Måns Bäckström
  
This project aims to build a simple "burger" application, focusing on collaboration and version control using Git and GitHub. The objective is to gain practical experience in software development workflows, including creating branches, handling pull requests and managing code quality.

-----------------------------------------------------------

** Purpose **

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of software collaboration and version control practices. By using GitHub, we learned how to work efficiently with repositories, commits, pushes, pulls, and merges. Additionally, we gained experience in various programming languages and learnt how to deal with code quality, teamwork and communication.

-----------------------------------------------------------
**Start the program**
To start the program, use the command: docker compose up --build.

** Workflow ** 


* Repository Creation *
One team member created the repository and invited others. We followed a branching strategy to avoid conflicts.


* Planning and Collaboration *
We planned the structure of the project and prioritized key features. We used OneNote for task division and Snapchat/Discord for real-time communication.
We put together a very detailed list of what roles we have and what they included in coding terms.


* Implementation *
Tasks were divided into modules, such as setting up a container and writing app.py and kitchen.py as seperate files to make it easier to work with.
Each member worked on a separate branch, and pull requests were made for code review before merging.


* Configuration Management * 
We used a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies and a Dockerfile for consistent development environments.


* Testing and Debugging *
Bugs were resolved using Visual Studio Code's debugging tools, and unit tests were added to ensure code quality.


* Final Code and Delivery *
After thorough testing, we polished the project and reviewed each others work through pull requests and then checked for grammar mistakes aswell as pep8 standard quality of the code and did a final push and merge.

** Reflection **


* Challenges *
Managing merge conflicts when multiple members worked on different branches was a major challenge. Good communication and commit discipline were crucial to avoid overwriting each other's code.
Managing communication was a big part of the project as it was the most important part. But we managed to have a good communication throughout the entire project to avoid overwrites aswell as doing their seperate work.


* Learnings *
We learned the importance of clear commit messages and frequent pushes to prevent conflicts. Working on separate branches and conducting pull requests enhanced our collaborative skills. Communication was vital in overcoming obstacles and keeping the project on track.


* Improvements *
In future projects, we could implement code reviews earlier and use more automated tests to catch bugs sooner. Enhanced communication would also ensure smoother progress.
